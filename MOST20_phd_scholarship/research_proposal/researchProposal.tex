\begin{abstract}
  Six Degree-of-Freedom (6DoF) Immersive video streaming is very challenging due to various data representations, 
  strict network condition and computing requirements ,and complex user experience models. In my PhD 
  study, we study on three research problems to overcome these three challenges.
  First, we study different data representations to understand their pros, cons, and suitable 
  usage scenarios. Second, we optimize the streaming systems to reduce the bandwidth requirements in immersive video streaming.
  Last, we design and conduct a series of user studies to derive the user experience.
  The results of these three steps lead to a fully-optimized immersive video streaming systems,
  which are crucial to many novel applications, including holographic conferences, 
  real scene streaming, remote surgery, and fire fighter (or military) training.
